## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second

## My process

### Built with

- ES6
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I definitely learned how awesome the modulo operator is and a new way of thinking how to use it! I didn't realize how valuable of a tool it was.

I also learned to start small. Initially I wanted to have the user be able to input values and make it more of a timer instead of a countdown. That proved to be too much to tackle all at once, so I decided to save the user input portion for the next project. That way I'm breaking code up into smaller (still re-usable!) chunks for each project.

### Continued development

I really want to practice more **vanilla JS** especially built-in objects. The layout using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** was challenging but I felt confident. When it came to the **JS** my initial starting point was pretty far off from my final code. I want to focus on simplifying the problem presented to me. I tend to add features I want and make the problem more complex than it is.

### Useful resources

- [Understanding Date and Time](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-date-and-time-in-javascript) - I'd never used the ```**Date**``` object before this challenge, so this article helped me understand the basics immensely.
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) - Always gotta check out MDN to get your foundations down!
