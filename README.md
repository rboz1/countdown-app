<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://rboz1.github.io/countdown-app/)


I definitely learned how awesome the modulo operator is and a new way of thinking how to use it! I didn't realize how valuable of a tool it was.

I also learned to start small. Initially I wanted to have the user be able to input values and make it more of a timer instead of a countdown. That proved to be too much to tackle all at once, so I decided to save the user input portion for the next project. That way I'm breaking code up into smaller (still re-usable!) chunks for each project.

I really want to practice more **vanilla JS** especially built-in objects. The layout using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** was challenging but I felt confident. When it came to the **JS** my initial starting point was pretty far off from my final code. I want to focus on simplifying the problem presented to me. I tend to add features I want and make the problem more complex than it is.
